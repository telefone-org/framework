## Highlights

Telefone framework is a Python interface to Telegram Bot API. It acts as a layer of convenience, providing useful tools to build powerful bots, and has many features like [text formatting], [file uploading], [blueprints], [middleware] and [FSM].

It does all of that while maintaining high performance and blazing speed, and is also widely customizable thanks to its thought out architecture.

```bash script
pip install telefone
```

## Examples

This example shows how easy it is to build a Telegram bot. Your bot is up and running in only **six** lines of code!

```python
from telefone import Bot

bot = Bot("your-token")


@bot.on.message()
async def handler(_) -> str:
    return "Hello world!"

bot.run_forever()
```
